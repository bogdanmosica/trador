 **ðŸ“¦ Chapter 3: Market Data Layer**

This is essential for:

* Feeding your **Strategy Module** (for signals)
* Powering your **Backtesting Engine** (real or simulated)
* Later enabling **Live Trading** (real-time updates)

Letâ€™s design this right.

## âœ… Chapter 3 Prompt â€“ Market Data Layer (Modular, API-Based)

 You are an expert in building real-time data systems for algorithmic trading. Iâ€™m developing a 24/7 crypto trading bot and have already designed:

 * A **modular Strategy Module** (signal-based, config-driven)
 * A **Backtesting Engine** that replays market history realistically

 Now I need a flexible, testable **Market Data Layer** that supports both **historical** and **live** data. The first exchange I want to support is **Binance**, using **1-minute OHLCV candles**.

 ---

 ### ðŸŽ¯ Objective

 Build a Market Data Layer that:

 * Can fetch **historical candles** from public APIs
 * Supports **live streaming or polling** (eventually WebSockets)
 * Provides data in a unified structure for Strategy and Backtest engines
 * Can be **swapped or mocked** for testing and offline use

 ---

 ### âœ… Functional Requirements

 #### 1. **Historical Data Fetching**

 * Pull 1-minute OHLCV candles from Binanceâ€™s REST API
 * Support configurable:

   * symbol (e.g., BTCUSDT)
   * interval (1m, 5m, etc.)
   * date range (start â†’ end timestamps)
 * Cache or save locally to avoid repeated fetches

 #### 2. **Live Market Data**

 * Provide a stream (or polling loop) to feed:

   * New candles in real time
   * (Future) trades, order book snapshots
 * Allow pluggable strategy listeners or pub/sub architecture
 * Simulate live flow in dev mode (e.g., using historical data with delay)

 #### 3. **Unified Data Format**

 * Normalize all incoming data to a consistent format:

   ```python
   {
     "timestamp": 1692182400000,
     "symbol": "BTCUSDT",
     "open": 28931.4,
     "high": 28960.1,
     "low": 28895.2,
     "close": 28942.7,
     "volume": 124.56
   }
   ```
 * Provide this as an iterator, generator, or queue for consumption

 #### 4. **Modular Design**

 * Create a `MarketDataProvider` base class/interface
 * Implement:

   * `BinanceRESTProvider` (historical candles)
   * `BinanceWebSocketProvider` (future live stream)
   * `MockProvider` (for testing)
 * Easily extend to other exchanges (Bybit, Coinbase, etc.)

 ---

 ### ðŸ”§ Tech Constraints

 * Use **Python 3.11+**
 * Use `aiohttp` or `httpx` for async API requests
 * Avoid tight coupling with strategy or backtester
 * Allow optional storage of data to local DB or file

 ---

 ### ðŸ‘‡ Your Deliverables

 1. Propose a clean folder/module structure for the Market Data Layer
 2. Design a base `MarketDataProvider` interface and at least one real implementation (`BinanceRESTProvider`)
 3. Show how a backtest or strategy would **consume normalized candle data** from this layer
 4. Suggest how to add live-mode streaming (with retry/heartbeat logic) later
 5. Include suggestions for unit testing this layer (e.g., using a mock provider)
