## 1. âœ… Revised Prompt â€“ Backtesting Engine (Realistic Simulation)

 You are an expert in building high-fidelity backtesting systems for crypto trading. Iâ€™m building a 24/7 crypto bot system using Python, and Iâ€™ve already built a modular Strategy Module that outputs signals. Now I want to build a **realistic, event-driven backtesting engine** that mirrors live trading behavior.

 ### ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:

 Simulate trading performance of strategies under realistic market conditions using data fetched from public exchange APIs (e.g. Binance). This includes modeling order types, latency, slippage, fills, and portfolio state.

 ---

 ### âœ… Functional Requirements

 #### 1. **Event-Driven Simulation Loop**

 * Load historical OHLCV (or trades) from public API
 * For each time interval:

   * Feed candle/tick to the strategy
   * Receive signal(s)
   * Simulate order generation, queuing, and fill logic
   * Update portfolio state (position, equity, margin, etc.)

 #### 2. **Order & Execution Modeling**

 * Support both **market and limit orders**
 * Simulate:

   * Partial fills and fill queues (priority in book)
   * Slippage (configurable per symbol/volatility)
   * Spread-based execution (e.g., canâ€™t assume mid-price)
   * TIFs (IOC, GTC, etc.)
   * Latency simulation (e.g., 250ms round trip)

 #### 3. **Data Interface**

 * Pull historical data from public exchange APIs (e.g., Binance, Bybit)
 * Modular adapter design (so later we can plug in different APIs or local caches)
 * Cache pulled data to avoid redundant API hits

 #### 4. **Portfolio & Accounting Engine**

 * Realistic position tracking:

   * Leverage
   * Entry/exit prices
   * Fee modeling (maker/taker)
 * Mark-to-market unrealized PnL
 * Track trades, equity, and exposure over time

 #### 5. **Metrics & Logs**

 * Standard output:

   * Equity curve
   * Trade list (entry/exit timestamps, size, PnL, order type)
   * Summary metrics: CAGR, max drawdown, Sharpe, Sortino, win rate, exposure
 * JSON and CSV export support
 * Optional: matplotlib/plotly for visualizing trades on charts

 ---

 ### ðŸ§± Architecture Constraints

 * Written in **Python 3.11+**
 * Reuses existing Strategy Module via `.generate_signals(market_data, position_state)`
 * Market data should be injected from a **Data Feed Adapter**
 * Strategy configs are loaded via YAML/JSON
 * Designed for **extensibility**, **testability**, and **repeatability**

 ---

 ### ðŸ§© Optional Design Ideas

 * Abstract classes:

   * `Backtester`
   * `MarketDataFeed`
   * `ExecutionSimulator`
   * `Order`
   * `TradeLog`
 * Support multi-symbol/multi-strategy in future
 * Parallelized backtests (across params or strategies)

 ---

 ### ðŸ‘‡ Your Deliverables:

 1. Propose a folder + module structure for the Backtesting Engine
 2. Design key classes: `Backtester`, `ExecutionEngine`, `Portfolio`, `Order`, `Trade`, `DataFeed`
 3. Show how to wire in a strategy and fetch data from Binanceâ€™s API
 4. Provide a skeleton backtest loop with mock data and a working market/limit order fill simulator
 5. Explain how this can later be extended to live mode or paper trading
